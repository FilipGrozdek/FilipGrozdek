                        <h1>Schumacher and Giovinazzi to fulfil Ferrari reserve role in 2022</h1>
                        <h2>Mick Schumacher could find himself driving a Ferrari Formula 1 car in 2022 as Team Principal Mattia Binotto revealed the Haas race driver will share the reserve role with fellow Ferrari Driver Academy racer Antonio Giovinazzi…</h2>
                        <p>Giovinazzi was left without a drive after Alfa Romeo opted to replace him with Zhou Guanyu for next season, after three campaigns with the team, and subsequently announced he would compete full-time in Formula E next year.</p>
                        <p>However, he was keen to keep one foot in F1 with a view of trying to find a race seat in 2023 – and will do so by extending his Ferrari relationship into a fifth year.</p>
                        <p>Speaking to selected media at Ferrari’s annual Christmas event, Team Principal Binotto said Giovinazzi will attend 12 races and fulfil the role of reserve, with Schumacher – who will be racing in his second season with Haas – available to stand in for the remaining 11.</p>
                        <p>Should Ferrari call on Schumacher, Haas would run their reserve Pietro Fittipaldi to drive alongside Nikita Mazepin. Binotto added that Giovinazzi will be available to stand-in for Ferrari’s customers Haas and Alfa Romeo if required.</p>
                        <p>Explaining the reasoning behind giving Schumacher, son of seven-time world champion Michael, the role of reserve, Binotto said: “He’s a Ferrari driver, we should not forget that. He has been part of our Ferrari Driver Academy. The reason we have the Ferrari Driver Academy is to identify the next Ferrari driver for the future.</p>
                        <p>“Being part of it, if you are doing well, no doubt you may have opportunities. He’s had already one season in F1, which is important. Mick through the season did well, he improved himself not only in terms of consistency, but as well in terms of speed.</p>
