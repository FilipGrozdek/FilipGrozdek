                    <h2>A brand-new set of rules mean brand-new cars for 20 drivers on the F1 grid, with changes at Alfa Romeo and Mercedes plus one rookie. Here is how the 2022 F1 grid will line up.</h2>
                    <p>George Russell partners seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes as Valtteri Bottas has left the team after five seasons, having helped the Silver Arrows clinch a record eighth consecutive constructors' championship. Another former Williams driver, Russell makes a long-awaited step up to the team that have dominated the turbo-hybrid era.</p>
                    <p>It's all the ones on Red Bull's cars this season, as 2021 drivers' title winner Max Verstappen sports the champion's #1 (instead of his usual #33) and Sergio Perez partners him. The pair continue their successful partnership, Mexican racer Perez having been confirmed to stay back in August 2021.</p>
                    <p>Carlos Sainz readies himself for his second season with Ferrari, who clinched P3 in the constructors' standings in 2021, as the team aim to fight the frontrunners. Charles Leclerc continues his successful tenure with the squad, hoping for a first win since 2019.</p>
                    <p>Lando Norris continues alongside Daniel Ricciardo with McLaren, who narrowly missed out on P3 to Ferrari last season but showed that they too are fighting their way back towards the top. After all, their one-two at Monza was the only such finish of the 2021 season.</p>
                    <p>An unchanged line-up for works squad Alpine, who had an undeniably strong season in 2021 with veteran Fernando Alonso taking a podium and helping team mate Esteban Ocon to a brilliant Hungarian Grand Prix victory. The pair aim to bring Alpine up to the pace of McLaren and Ferrari and beyond.</p>
