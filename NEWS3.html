                    <h1>HAMILTON VS VERSTAPPEN: Why their rivalry has the potential to be the greatest in F1 history</h1>
                    <h2>Sports comprise networks of rivalries. F1 is no exception, with the ever-shifting sands of battles between drivers and teams creating new and engaging storylines every season. But sometimes, a rivalry forms that towers above the rest, defining not just F1 in that era, but becoming a defining battle in sport as a whole.</h2>
                    <p>That’s what the Max Verstappen versus Lewis Hamilton World Championship fight was in 2021. So intense, thrilling, controversial and dramatic was this battle that it can legitimately be considered as potentially one of the great rivalries, up there with Alain Prost vs Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher vs Mika Hakkinen, James Hunt vs Niki Lauda and the other legendary duels that define F1.</p>
                    <p>Ever since Verstappen burst onto the F1 scene with Toro Rosso in 2015 and showed increasingly frequent glimpses of his brilliance, he has been on a collision course with Hamilton. It felt inevitable that there would be a reckoning between the established legend and the rising star, but it wasn’t until 2021 that Red Bull produced a car equal to the task.</p>
                    <p>During the prelude, there were glimpses of the battle that was to come: Verstappen diving past Hamilton to win in Malaysia 2017; their brush in Bahrain 2018 that gave the Red Bull driver a puncture; Verstappen’s off after being suckered into making a high-risk passing attempt in China the same year; their battles in 2019 at Monaco, the Hungaroring and Interlagos. This slow-burn build-up to 2021 meant the pair already had a storied history as the foundation of their rivalry.</p>
                    <p>F1’s defining rivalry also benefitted from such anticipation, with Senna on the radar as a future world champion for four years before he took on, and beat, McLaren team mate Prost to the 1988 title.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton is just over 12 and a half years older than Verstappen, and holds all the major achievement records in F1: most poles, most wins and a share in most titles with Michael Schumacher. This made Verstappen the potential usurper in 2021 in what is a rare ‘generational battle’ in F1 history.</p>
                    <p>Such clashes are vanishingly rare as they require two drivers – one the defining of the current era, the other possibly of the next – to overlap. The Prost vs Lauda rivalry of 1984 exemplifies this, but too often circumstances have prevented such battles – most recently with tragedy preventing the tantalising Schumacher vs Senna championship fight of 1994 playing out.This made the stakes sky-high, with Hamilton as motivated to prove himself against yet another star driver as Verstappen was to dethrone him.</p>
